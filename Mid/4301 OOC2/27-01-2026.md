## Substitution principle

A base class is a general class that acts as a foundation for more specific classes, known as derived classes. The base class defined common properties and methods that the derived classes will inherit. 

Method Overriding is used. 

Abstraction

### Sub typing Relationship
A sub type is a type that can be used in any place where its super type is expected i.e. super type and sub type is interchangeable. 

*Can be used relationship*


```
Dog dog = new Dog();
Cat cat = new Cat();

Animal dog2 = new Dog(); // Substitution Principle

```

## LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)

$$SUBTYPES\;\;MUST\;\;BE\;\;SUBSTITUTABLE\;\;FOR\;\;THEIR\;\;BASE\;\;TYPES$$
```
class Vehicle {
	public void startEnging();
	public void drive();
	public void stop();
	}
	
class Bicycle extends Vehicle {
	@Override
	public void startEngine() {
		throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Bicycle does not have an engine");
	}
}
```

But, what if you forget to do this override? 

```
abstract class Vehicle {
	public void drive();
	public void stop();
}

class MotorVehicle extends Vehicle {
	public void startEngine();
}
	
```
