## 1. Vector Spaces

A **Vector Space** is a collection of vectors that is closed under linear combinations.

### The Requirements
To be a valid Vector Space, the set of vectors must satisfy two main operations without leaving the space:
1.  **Addition:** If $v$ and $w$ are in the space, then $v + w$ must be in the space.
2.  **Scalar Multiplication:** If $v$ is in the space and $c$ is any constant, then $cv$ must be in the space.

> [!SUMMARY] Linearity
> Combining these two rules: All **linear combinations** ($cv + dw$) must stay inside the space.

### Examples
1.  **$\mathbb{R}^3$:** The space of all real 3-dimensional vectors.
    *   You can add any 3D vectors or multiply them by scalars, and the result is still a 3D vector.
2.  **$\mathbb{R}^n$:** The space of all column vectors with $n$ components.

## 2. Subspaces

A **Subspace** is a vector space *inside* another vector space. It is a subset of vectors that satisfies the vector space requirements on its own.

> [!IMPORTANT] The Golden Rule
> **Every subspace must contain the zero vector.**
> Why? Because if the space contains vector $v$, it must contain $0 \cdot v$, which is the zero vector.

### Geometric Examples in $\mathbb{R}^3$
If we look inside $\mathbb{R}^3$, what constitutes a subspace?

1.  **The whole space:** $\mathbb{R}^3$ itself.
2.  **A Plane through the origin:**
    *   If you take two vectors on the plane and add them, the result is on the plane.
    *   If you stretch a vector on the plane, it stays on the plane.
    *   *Visual:* Like a sheet of paper extending infinitely through $(0,0,0)$.
3.  **A Line through the origin:**
    *   Infinite line passing through $(0,0,0)$.
4.  **The Zero Vector:** The single point $Z = \{ \mathbf{0} \}$. This is the smallest possible subspace.

### Non-Examples
*   A plane that does **not** go through the origin is NOT a subspace (fails the zero vector rule; fails scalar multiplication).
*   A quarter of a plane (fails scalar multiplication by negative numbers).

## 3. Operations on Subspaces

Suppose we have two subspaces, $P$ (a plane through origin) and $L$ (a line through origin) in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

### Union ($P \cup L$)
*   **Question:** Is the set of all vectors in $P$ *or* $L$ (put them together) a subspace?
*   **Answer: NO.**
*   **Reason:** We cannot add. If you take a vector $v \in P$ and $w \in L$, the sum $v+w$ is usually off in some other direction, outside both the plane and the line.

```
      |
      |  L (Line)
      | /
  ____|/____ P (Plane)
     /|
    / |
```
*If you add a vector lying on P to a vector lying on L, the resultant vector floats in space between them.*

### Intersection ($S \cap T$)
*   **Question:** If $S$ and $T$ are subspaces, is their intersection (vectors in *both* $S$ and $T$) a subspace?
*   **Answer: YES.**
*   **Proof:**
    1.  If $v$ and $w$ are in the intersection, they are in both $S$ and $T$.
    2.  Because $S$ is a subspace, $v+w$ is in $S$.
    3.  Because $T$ is a subspace, $v+w$ is in $T$.
    4.  Therefore, $v+w$ is in the intersection. (Same logic applies to scalar multiplication).

> [!NOTE] Example of Intersection
> If you intersect a Plane ($P$) and a non-parallel Line ($L$) through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^3$, the intersection is just the **Zero Vector** (which is a valid subspace).

## 4. The Column Space of A: $C(A)$

Given a matrix $A$, the Column Space consists of all linear combinations of the columns of $A$.

### Definition
If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, the columns are in $\mathbb{R}^m$.
$$C(A) = \text{Subspace of } \mathbb{R}^m$$

### Connection to Linear Systems ($Ax=b$)
We are solving for linear combinations of columns.
$$Ax = x_1(\text{col}_1) + x_2(\text{col}_2) + \dots + x_n(\text{col}_n) = b$$

*   **Key Insight:** The equation $Ax=b$ has a solution **if and only if** the right-hand side $b$ is in the Column Space of $A$.

---

## 5. The Null Space of A: $N(A)$

The Null Space consists of all solutions $x$ to the homogeneous equation.

### Definition
If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, the vectors $x$ are in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
$$N(A) = \{ x \mid Ax = 0 \}$$
$$N(A) = \text{Subspace of } \mathbb{R}^n$$

### Proof that $N(A)$ is a Subspace
We must check if solutions add up to solutions.
1.  Suppose $Ax = 0$ and $Ax^* = 0$.
2.  Check sum: $A(x + x^*) = Ax + Ax^* = 0 + 0 = 0$. (True)
3.  Check scalar: $A(cx) = c(Ax) = c(0) = 0$. (True)

## 6. Detailed Example (The "Strang Matrix")

Let $A$ be a $4 \times 3$ matrix. Note columns are in $\mathbb{R}^4$, variables $x$ are in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 2 \\
2 & 1 & 3 \\
3 & 1 & 4 \\
4 & 1 & 5
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Analyzing $C(A)$ (Column Space)
*   **Space:** Subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$.
*   **Dependence:** Look at the columns.
    *   Col 1: $\begin{bmatrix} 1, 2, 3, 4 \end{bmatrix}^T$
    *   Col 2: $\begin{bmatrix} 1, 1, 1, 1 \end{bmatrix}^T$
    *   Col 3: $\begin{bmatrix} 2, 3, 4, 5 \end{bmatrix}^T$
    *   *Observation:* $\text{Col}_1 + \text{Col}_2 = \text{Col}_3$.
*   **Conclusion:** The third column does not add "new directions". The column space is described entirely by Col 1 and Col 2. It is a **2-dimensional plane** inside 4-dimensional space.

### Analyzing $Ax = b$
Does $Ax=b$ always have a solution for every $b \in \mathbb{R}^4$?
*   **No.** We have 4 equations and only 3 unknowns. Most $b$'s are unreachable.
*   We can only solve it if $b$ lies on the plane defined by columns 1 and 2.

### Analyzing $N(A)$ (Null Space)
*   **Space:** Subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$.
*   We want to solve $Ax = 0$.
    $$x_1(\text{col}_1) + x_2(\text{col}_2) + x_3(\text{col}_3) = 0$$
*   We found the relation $\text{Col}_1 + \text{Col}_2 - \text{Col}_3 = 0$.
*   This corresponds to the solution vector:
    $$x = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}$$
*   **The Full Null Space:** Any multiple of this solution works ($cx$).
    $$N(A) = c \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}$$
*   **Geometry:** The null space is a **Line** in $\mathbb{R}^3$ passing through the origin.
