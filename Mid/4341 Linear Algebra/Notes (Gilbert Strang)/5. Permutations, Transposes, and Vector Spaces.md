## 1. Permutations ($P$)

Permutation matrices are used to execute **row exchanges**. In Gaussian elimination, we need these if a zero appears in a pivot position but there is a non-zero entry below it.

### The Factorization
If row exchanges are required during elimination, the factorization changes from $A = LU$ to:

$$PA = LU$$

Where:
*   $P$ is the permutation matrix (identity matrix with rows reordered).
*   $A$ is the original matrix.
*   $L$ is lower triangular.
*   $U$ is upper triangular.

> [!NOTE] Purpose of $P$
> $P$ puts the rows of $A$ into the "good order" (pivots on diagonal) so that factorization can proceed without row exchanges on the resulting matrix.

### Properties of Permutation Matrices
1.  **Inverse:** Permutations are invertible. The inverse puts the rows back in their original order.
2.  **Transpose Property:** For any permutation matrix, the inverse is the transpose.
    $$P^{-1} = P^T$$
    Therefore:
    $$P^T P = I$$
3.  **Count:** There are $n!$ (n factorial) permutation matrices of size $n \times n$.
    *   Order 3 ($3 \times 3$): $3! = 6$ matrices.
    *   Order 4 ($4 \times 4$): $4! = 24$ matrices.

## 2. Transposes ($A^T$)

The transpose of a matrix exchanges its rows and columns.
*   **Formula:** $(A^T)_{ij} = A_{ji}$
*   If $A$ is $m \times n$, then $A^T$ is $n \times m$.

### Example
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \quad \xrightarrow{\text{Transpose}} \quad A^T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 4 \\ 3 & 3 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

### Symmetric Matrices
A matrix is **symmetric** if the transpose equals the original matrix.
$$A^T = A$$
*   *Constraint:* Symmetric matrices must be square.
*   *Visual:* The matrix is mirrored across the main diagonal.

### The Product $R^T R$
For **any** rectangular matrix $R$ (size $m \times n$), the product $R^T R$ is always a symmetric matrix.

**Visualizing the Dimensions:**
$$
\underset{(n \times m)}{R^T} \times \underset{(m \times n)}{R} = \underset{(n \times n)}{\text{Symmetric Matrix}}
$$

**Proof:**
To prove a matrix is symmetric, take its transpose and see if you get the original back.
$$
(R^T R)^T = R^T (R^T)^T = R^T R
$$
*(Recall rule: $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$)*

**Example Calculation:**
Let $R = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 4 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ (can be square or rectangular).
$$
R^T R = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 4 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 17 & 6 \\ 6 & 5 \end{bmatrix}
$$
*Result:* $\begin{bmatrix} 17 & 6 \\ 6 & 5 \end{bmatrix}$ is symmetric.

## 3. Vector Spaces

This marks the transition from computational algebra (elimination) to the conceptual heart of linear algebra.

### Definition
A **Vector Space** is a collection of vectors that is **closed** under:
1.  **Vector Addition** ($v + w$)
2.  **Scalar Multiplication** ($cv$)

Meaning: If you add any two vectors in the space, or multiply any vector by a number, the result stays *inside* the space.

### Examples
*   **$\mathbb{R}^2$:** All 2-dimensional real vectors (The x-y plane).
    $$v = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}$$
*   **$\mathbb{R}^3$:** All 3-dimensional real vectors.
*   **$\mathbb{R}^n$:** All n-dimensional real column vectors.

## 4. Subspaces

A **Subspace** is a vector space that is contained inside another vector space.

### Requirements for a Subspace
To be a valid subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$, a set of vectors must satisfy three requirements:
1.  **Contains the Zero Vector:** ($\vec{0}$ must be in the set).
2.  **Closed under Addition:** If $v$ and $w$ are in the set, $v+w$ is in the set.
3.  **Closed under Scalar Multiplication:** If $v$ is in the set, $cv$ is in the set (for any number $c$).

> [!WARNING] Why the Zero Vector is Mandatory
> If a space must be closed under multiplication, we must be allowed to multiply by the scalar $0$. Since $0 \cdot v = \vec{0}$, the zero vector must exist in every valid subspace.

### Visualizing Subspaces in $\mathbb{R}^2$

1.  **All of $\mathbb{R}^2$:** The whole plane. (Valid)
2.  **Any Line through the Origin:** (Valid)
    *   If you take a vector on the line and scale it, you stay on the line.
    *   If you add two vectors on the line, you stay on the line.
3.  **The Zero Vector $\vec{0}$:** The single point $Z = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$. (Valid - the smallest subspace).

#### Counter-Examples (NOT Subspaces)
*   **A line NOT through the origin:** Fails because it lacks $\vec{0}$. Also fails closure (multiplying a vector on the line by 0 takes you off the line).
*   **The First Quadrant:** Contains vectors with positive coordinates.
    *   *Fails scalar multiplication:* If $v = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$, multiplying by $-1$ gives $\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}$, which is outside the quadrant.

### Subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^3$
1.  All of $\mathbb{R}^3$.
2.  Any **Plane** through the origin.
3.  Any **Line** through the origin.
4.  The **Zero Vector** alone.

## 5. The Column Space ($C(A)$)

How do we construct a subspace using a matrix? We look at the columns.

Given a matrix $A$:
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$
The columns are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
*   Column 1: $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$
*   Column 2: $\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$

These two vectors alone are **not** a subspace (they are just two arrows). To create a subspace, we must take **all linear combinations** of these columns.

### Definition: Column Space
The Column Space of $A$, denoted $C(A)$, contains all linear combinations of the columns of $A$.
*   Geometrically: In the example above, $C(A)$ is a **plane** passing through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^3$ defined by the two column vectors.

> [!INFO] Key Concept
> If you take a set of vectors (columns) and "fill them out" by taking all possible linear combinations (additions and scalings), the result is always a **Subspace**.

This relates back to $Ax=b$. Solving $Ax=b$ asks: "Is $b$ a combination of the columns of $A$?"
*   In new language: **"Is the vector $b$ inside the Column Space $C(A)$?"**
