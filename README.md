## Notes Repository Quick Start

1. Install [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) and [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).
2. Open a terminal in the folder where you want the notes.
3. Clone the repo:
    
```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/SMTEmon/2-1
```

4. Open Obsidian → **Open Folder as Vault** → select the cloned folder.
5. Install and enable the **Git plugin** in Obsidian (Community Plugins).
6. Use the Git sidebar to **Pull** updates regularly.
7. You cannot push changes unless you are a collaborator — local edits stay on your device. 
    

✅ Done! You’re synced and ready to go.
